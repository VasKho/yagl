## About

YAGL stands for "Yet Another Graph Language" (thanks to [FallenChromium](https://github.com/FallenChromium) for such a perfect name).

This is an implementation of graph library to create different graph based knowledge processing machines.

## Features

- Asynchronous graph processing
- Different types of nodes
- Fast access to nodes
- Context based approach to processing
- Everything-is-a-node memory implementation

## Requirements

This library is atomic so the only thing ~~they fear is you~~ you need to start is golang standard library.

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/VasKho/yagl@latest
```
